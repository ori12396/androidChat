# androidChat

Welcome to our chat app!

This is an online chatting application that you can use to interact with your friends !

You can also check out the app's rating page and submit your impressions from our app! Spread the love!

We have also added an option to register and log in from your android device!

We have used the following technoligies in our project:

*JavaScript
*React
*ASP.NET
*SignalR
*axios



Prerequisites:
Before we start rolling, Please check that you have installed the following on your PC:

npm and nodeJS 
.NET (dotnet)



Let's get started:
First, you can get the code by executing the following commands:

$git clone URL https://github.com/ori12396/androidChat.git
$cd androidChat
then execute the server side by runing the server.
Then you can exectute the command 
$npm start 

to start the chat app 

IMPORTANT NOTE : Our server runs on localhost 7000 . if somereason you change the server url on your pc , you need to update the variable called - serverUrl in App.js file , to make the app work.
same logic to the rate app - you can change the <a HREF > at the bottom of the pages-Chat.js, Login.js and Register.js  
  
  YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE S IN THE HTTPS OF THE SERVER ADDRESS SO IT'LL WORK WITH THE ANDROID 
  AND THE SERVER URL IN APP.JS (LINE 184) TO BE WITHOUT THE S
